# Ground Control

Ground Control is an application to help deal with multi-repository development using a user friendly web interface.

You define workspaces in a YAML file.
A workspace contains multiple projects.
A project corresponds to a branch of a repository.

The Ground Control user interface allows you to perform operations across the projects of a workspace, including:

- Cloning all repositories (defaults to `$HOME/groundcontrol/workspaces/WORKSPACE/PROJECT`)
- Check the status of repositories against their origins
- Pull all outdated repositories
- Define workspace wide tasks
- Create scripts to launch multi-repository applications

## Development

Clone to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/stratumn/groundcontrol` (no Go module support yet).

### Server

```
dep ensure
ssh-add # <---- to use your SSH key for accessing private repos
go run server/server.go [groundcontrol.yml]
```

Some files are generated by [gqlgen](https://gqlgen.com) and should not be updated by hand.
Run `go generate ./...` to update them.

### UI

```
cd ui
yarn install
yarn dev
```
